# Homework 1
## Task 1
The Task 1 file takes the start state and goal state arrays as arguments. Run the program as python3 task1.py start_state_array goal_state_array
max_runtime_of_program_in_seconds .
<br><br>
An example of running the program is python NMSSourceCodeFile.py 1,13,3,5,6,9,11,0,8,12,14,10,7,16,15,4,17,2
1,13,3,5,6,9,11,14,8,12,16,10,7,17,15,0,4,2 60 . In this case, we have the two state arrays and a max run time for the program of 60s.
<br><br>
The output will be written to an output.txt file if a path is found in the allotted time.

## Task 2
The Task 2 file takes the start state and goal state arrays as arguments. Run the program as python3 task1.py start_state_array goal_state_array
max_runtime_of_program_in_seconds .
<br><br>
An example of running the program is python NMSSourceCodeFile.py 1,13,3,5,6,9,11,0,8,12,14,10,7,16,15,4,17,2
1,13,3,5,6,9,11,14,8,12,16,10,7,17,15,0,4,2 60 . In this case, we have the two state arrays and a max run time for the program of 60s.
<br><br>
The output will be written to an output.txt file if a path is found in the allotted time.

## Task 3
The Task 3 file takes the start state and goal state arrays as arguments. Run the program as python NMSSourceCodeFile.py start_state_array goal_state_array
max_runtime_of_program_in_seconds .
<br><br>
An example of running the program is python NMSSourceCodeFile.py 1,13,3,5,6,9,11,0,8,12,14,10,7,16,15,4,17,2
1,13,3,5,6,9,11,14,8,12,16,10,7,17,15,0,4,2 60 . In this case, we have the two state arrays and a max run time for the program of 60s.
